# Duke-Food-App
Web app to allow Duke students to track their eating habits and food point usage. Really bad code but a good learning process.

The website was built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It makes calls to an express backend, which interacts with a MongoDB database. 

Originally did not plan to use git for this project, as the code contains a lot of bad practices, but it seems git is one way to deploy this website onto AWS Amplify.
