# Duke-Food-App
Web app to allow Duke students to track their eating habits and food point usage. The website was built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It makes calls to an Express.js backend, which interacts with a MongoDB database. Because this project was my introduction into any sort of development, the code contains many bad practices. I plan to remake the site in the future using a relational database, and also upgrade both the meal logging process and the meal stats presentation.
